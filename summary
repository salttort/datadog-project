#Project Summary

When focusing on the design I tried to keep it on brand and something that would be cohesive on the homepage of the website. The color scheme uses the brand purple plus other colors picked from the website while also assuring ADA compliance for color contrast. Since I don't have the National web font I used Helvetica but being integrated with the larger website that should be modified. The resource cards are limited at 5 and are responsive. I beleive having the cards all on the screen is better for UX than having a carousel which users may continue to scroll before the content even displays. The stretched-link hover effect should make it easier for user motor skill issues because of the larger area to click.

I tried to keep the structural in the HTML, styling in the CSS, and logic in the JS. That should make it easier for other developers to make updates when necessary. That is why I chose to make a <template> for the resource cards. I tried to keep the code minimal and as efficient as possible. I embedded the JSON data in the JS to avoid CORs issues but on the actual domain it would be in it's on file to update as needed. The populateFilterOptions and renderResources function should take whatever data are in the JSON but the rendered resources limit at 5 which is good for scalability when adding more resources to the JSON. The is if logic for when no results are available. To scale for more potentail resources a "view all resources" button could be added. When integrating the html component it would need to be modified and the resources-container could be injected onto the homepage of the website with some additional javascript.
